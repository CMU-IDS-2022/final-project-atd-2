## Abstract
Climate change is an area of growing concern, and its impact can be seen in various sectors of society throughout the world. While this is a vast topic, for the purpose of our final project we have narrowed it down to a few specific areas and questions. Climate change can be analyzed in terms of increase in energy consumption, increased Co2 levels and natural disasters. However, the effects of climate change can be far more complex than what such a simple analysis would indicate. We have built visualizations that convey the subtle effects of climate change.

The energy consumption visualization consists of world maps incorporating heat maps which visibly reflects the amount of energy consumed by each Country in the world. Through this visualization, we let the user explore the what if scenario of the whole world living with the same per capita energy consumption of a particular country. This visualization highlights how the whole world living like the currently developed countries could be disastrous in terms of CO2 emissions.
The energy prediction chart uses linear regression to estimate energy demand and production in the future. This will allow government bodies to make calculated decisions about how to reduce the consumption.

The Climate Impact and Actions Implemented graph displays the various types of climate hazards that have occurred across countries and will allow individuals as well as government organizations to understand which action is to be implemented if a certain natural disaster occurs. The impact of these actions in terms of reduction in CO2 levels has also been visualized.

## Work distribution

We went through various datasets and research papers before finalizing out topic. Daily brainstorming of ideas allowed us to choose to develop our project on the causes and impact of Climate change. For the literature review process each one of us took up a research paper and analyzed it thoroughly to come up with interesting questions that we could answer.

We decided to select four key areas and come up with visualizations for the following:

1)  Energy Consumption

2)  Energy Prediction

3)  Impact of Climate Change

4)  Actions to be implemented against Climate change

We first came up with rough sketch ideas for each area and got feedback regarding the sketches from the TA's. This allowed us to improve on areas that we were lacking in.
Dhruv worked on the visualizations related to the energy consumption, Anam worked with the prediction visualizations, Trisha and Disha worked on the Impact of Climate change and the actions to be implemented against Climate change.
