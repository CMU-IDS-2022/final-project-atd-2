## Work distribution

We went through various datasets and research papers before finalizing
out topic. Daily brainstorming of ideas allowed us to choose to develop
our project on the causes and impact of Climate change. For the
literature review process each one of us took up a research paper and
analyzed it thoroughly to come up with interesting questions that we
could answer.

We decided to select four key areas and come up with visualizations for
the following:

1)  Energy Consumption

2)  Energy Prediction

3)  Impact of Climate Change

4)  Actions to be implemented against Climate change

We first came up with rough sketch ideas for each area and got
feedback regarding the sketches from the TA's. This allowed us to
improve on areas that we were lacking in.
Dhruv worked on the visualizations related to the energy consumption,
Anam worked with the prediction visualizations, Trisha and Disha
worked on the Impact of Climate change and the actions to be
implemented against Climate change.
