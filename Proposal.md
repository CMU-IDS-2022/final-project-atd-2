# CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTION & VISUALIZATION

## Introduction 
Climate change is an area of growing concern and its impact can be seen in various sectors of society throughout the world. While this is a vast topic, for the purposes of our final project we have narrowed it down to a few specific areas and questions.
Climate change can be analyzed in terms of increase in variance of temperature, sea levels, and natural disasters. However, the effects of climate change can be far more complex than what such a simple analysis would indicate. We want to build visualizations that can also convey the subtle effects of climate change. 

## Goals of the Project

- While many countries that have achieved post-scarcity are trying to find ways to reduce energy consumption, there are many developing countries where the energy footprint of people is very low simply because they are living in inhumane conditions. A humane plan for climate change should account for the fact that the energy consumption of these countries will and should increase. We want to investigate how visualizations can be used to convey this idea.
- We want to convey and quantify how much control an individual has over climate change. Are decisions made by individuals like turning off the tap while brushing or walking instead of driving a car contributing anything significant towards the fight against climate change? Or is most of the climate change due to industries? We expect the answer to be somewhere in between — individual choices probably also affect what industries get built. We want to convey these points using our visualizations.
- We also want to focus on making it easier for countries to have access to the change in temperatures on a monthly/yearly basis in the form of a visualization, rather than trying to gain insights directly from reading thousands of numbers loaded in the datasets.
- Another aspect of climate change would be climate migration. We want to predict possible migration patterns based on factors like availability of clean water and areas that become more conducive to human living as the climate changes.
- What solutions can countries implement to reduce the current global warming rates in the next 3 years? Given the current rate of improvement in Carbon Sequestration technologies, would it ever be helpful. What about the energy requirements of these technologies? Do current trends in clean energy production indicate a good enough growth to be able to handle the energy demand of carbon sequestration?
- Given that some effects of climate change are inevitable — which countries will be the most affected and how can they be helped?



## Target Audience 
Our target audience will include citizens having access to these data visualizations who will be able to understand how their daily activities are impacting the climate. Based on these visualizations they can make conscious decisions to reduce global warming.

We also aim to make the visualizations useful enough to be useful for government bodies of countries who will be able to make calculated decisions based on the data and predictions provided via the visualizations created.

## Dataset
We are going to look at a couple of different resources to get the data we need to make predictions and visualization. Firstly, we are using the UN climate change website to gather information about the issue and countries that are experiencing the worst consequences of climate change. UN also exposes data regarding the healthcare and poverty level indicators for countries. Another resource is the NASA global climate change website. The research is carried out by the climatic research unit. Lastly, we will also be exploring a dataset on kaggle to come up with the most effective visualizations which would be answering the questions as mentioned above.

## Conclusion
Overall, we aim to uncover patterns of climate change and their impact. As well as, creating  a predictive model will hopefully help countries realize the drastic effect climate change will have. This absolutely necessary information to countries will allow them to make informed decisions with respect to avoiding or at least attempting to limit the dire consequences. 

# Sketches and Data Analysis

## Data Processing. 
Do you have to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?  Show some screenshots of your data to demonstrate you have explored it.

## System Design. 
How will you display your data? What types of interactions will you support? Provide some sketches that you have for the system design.
